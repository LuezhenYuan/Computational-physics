# MCMC[1]
1. sample from a given distribution
2. more efficient than random walk
3. sample in spaces of high dimensionality
4. how many times a state appear
5. detailed balance is a sufficient confition for ensuring that the required distribution is invariant.
6. the sampling sequence is not a set of independent samples from a given distribution, but are highly correlated.
7. Under the circumstances that the Markov chain can have only one equilibrium distribution(which is the given distribution), will a Markov chain converge to the desired distribution.
## Term
1. proposal distribution, transition probability
2. invariant distribuition, equilibrium distribution
3. detailed balance
4. equilibrium distribution
5. ergodicity property, ergodicity Markov chain can have only one equilibrium distribution
