# Multiple data sets per file
# For gnuplot, blank lines in a data file are significant. A single blank line indicates a discontinuity in the data.
# In contrast, double blank lines are used to distinguish data sets in the file. Each set can be addressed in the plot command as if it were in a separate file using the index directive to plot .
